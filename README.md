# School_District_Analysis
This was a Data Analysis Project using Anaconda and Jupyter to practice basic functions available in these programs.

# Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Data analysts are often given raw data and we must be able to properly 'clean' this data and be able to format and present it in  a way that is the most useful to whoever it is that we present it to.  In this project we are given two 'comma separated value'(CSV) files related to the school districts and the performance of the students in these districts.

The analysis was completed in the Jupyter Notebook program, and we used features of Anaconda and Python to let us access a tool called "pandas" to complete a detailed breakdown of the raw data we were given. The data was moved into a DataFrame, or a 2 dimensional structure similar to a spreadsheet which allowed us to better visualize the data.  Each file was originally place in its own Dataframe, but Python allowed us to merge these two frames into a single frame that allows for easier analysis.

## How is the district summary affected?

The district summary dataframe gives us the overall results of all students across all the schools.  The data provided gives us the average, and with this we can compare a school or student's performance compared to the entire population of students.

## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

## Math and reading scores by grade

## Scores by school spending

## Scores by school size

## Scores by school type

# Summary: 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
